    <ol>
      <li>
        Make a spice mix by combining garam masala, tandoori masala, curry
        powder, cumin, cardamom, cayenne, salt, and black pepper in a small
        bowl; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken in a large bowl and add 1/2 of the spice mixture; turn to
        coat evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add
        chicken; cook and stir until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove
        from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a large saucepan over medium
        heat. Add onion; cook and stir until soft and translucent, about 5
        minutes. Stir in remainder of the spice mixture, garlic, lemon juice,
        and ginger; cook and stir until combined, about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir tomato puree into onion mixture and cook, stirring frequently,
        about 2 minutes. Pour in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low
        and simmer sauce, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes. Remove from
        heat.
      </li>

        Blend cashews in a blender until finely ground. Add sauce to the
        blender; puree until smooth.
      </li>

        Pour blended sauce over chicken in the skillet. Simmer until thickened,
        10 to 15 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.
