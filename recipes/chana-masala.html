    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Grind onion, tomato, ginger, garlic, and chile pepper together in a food
        processor into a paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry bay leaves in
        hot oil until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour the paste into the
        skillet and cook until the oil begins to separate from the mixture and
        is golden brown in color, 2 to 3 minutes. Season the mixture with chili
        powder, coriander, gram masala, turmeric, and salt; cook and stir until
        very hot, 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir enough water into the mixture to get a thick gravy; bring to a boil
        and stir chickpeas into the gravy. Reduce heat to medium and cook until
        the chickpeas are heated through, 5 to 7 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.
      </li>
