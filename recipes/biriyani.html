    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in yogurt and
        vinegar. Add onion; cook and stir until golden and tender. Add tomatoes,
        chile peppers, garlic, and ginger paste. Cook and stir until tomatoes
        are tender. Season with garam masala, mint, salt, and pepper. Stir in
        cilantro.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken into tomato-onion mixture in the skillet. Reduce heat to
        medium-low, cover, and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until
        chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about
        45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into meat should read
        at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, bring water and rice to a boil in a large pot. Mix in
        cinnamon stick, bay leaf, green cardamom, and black cardamom. Season
        with salt. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until rice is tender
        and water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Discard cinnamon stick, bay
        leaf, and cardamom.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread 1/2 of the cooked rice in the bottom of a large serving dish.
        Pour chicken mixture on top. Cover with remaining cooked rice. Sprinkle
        with food coloring; mix to serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
